## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The Xcode does not connect to github. 
I am still unable to copy it directly from Xcode, therefore i uploaded the files to github by myself. Hope, you can read my codes nicely and work out nicely. 
In the beginning, I didn't realize my user interface need to be set to storyboard, so at first I create the app interface in launchboard.storyboard instead of main
